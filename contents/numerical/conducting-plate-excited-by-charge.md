Let A, B, and C be points on $xy$-plane in freespace.  
There is an external charge. This charge produces electric potentials.  
Measured electric potentials at points A, B, and C are 1, 1.5, and 2, respectively.  
```math
\begin{align}V_A &= 1.0 \\V_A &= 1.5 \\V_A &= 2.0 \end{align} 


```  
Placing a 3 by 1 cm. conducting plate at the points A, B, and C as shown in figure below.

Assume that a constant surface charge density is induced on each 1 by 1 cm plate by the external charge.
